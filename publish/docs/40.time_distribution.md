# Time Distribution

You can define a time distribution range on stopwatch groups to plot execution time distribution graphs.

``` scala
import stopwatch.Stopwatch
import stopwatch.StopwatchRange
import stopwatch.TimeUnit._

// somewhere in your code, before using the stopwatch
// distribution:  0s to 15s in 500ms intervals
Stopwatch.range = StopwatchRange(0 seconds, 15 seconds, 500 millis)
```

## Resetting statistics

You may programmatically reset the values of stopwatches if your application has multiple cycles or if you want to recalibrate after the JVM ("HotSpot compiler") has had time to optimize your code.

``` scala
import stopwatch.Stopwatch

Stopwatch.reset("test")
```

## Displaying statistics

The "low-tech" way to display statistics is to use one of the __toString__ methods: __toShortString__, __toMediumString__, __toLongString__.  This can be useful if you want to log statistics directly to the __Console__ or through an existing logging frameworks, such as Log4J.

``` scala
scala> val stats = Stopwatch.snapshot("test")

// summary only
scala> s.toShortString
res3: String = Stopwatch "test" {hit=2, min=1838ms, avg=2148ms, max=2457ms, total=4296ms, stdDev=437ms}
```

<br/>

``` scala
// includes thread info
scala> s.toMediumString
res4: String = Stopwatch "test" {hits=2, throughput=0.814/s, minTime=1838ms, avgTime=2148ms, maxTime=2457ms, totalTime=4296ms, stdDev=437ms, currentThreads=0, avgThreads=1.50, maxThreads=2, first=2009-12-21 11:22:54.708 PST, last=2009-12-21 11:22:57.166 PST}
```

<br/>

``` scala
// includes threads + time distribution
scala> s.toLongString
res5: String = Stopwatch "test" {hits=2, throughput=0.814/s, minTime=1838ms, avgTime=2148ms, maxTime=2457ms, totalTime=4296ms, stdDev=437ms, currentThreads=0, avgThreads=1.50, maxThreads=2, first=2009-12-21 11:22:54.708 PST, last=2009-12-21 11:22:57.166 PST} Distribution {under=0, 0-1000ms: 0, 1000-2000ms: 1, 2000-3000ms: 1, 3000-4000ms: 0, 4000-5000ms: 0, 5000-6000ms: 0, 6000-7000ms: 0, 7000-8000ms: 0, 8000-9000ms: 0, 9000-10000ms: 0, over=0}
```

The standard __toString__ method is equivalent to __toMediumString__.

You can also use the "StopwatchStatistic":StopwatchStatistic.html interface to obtain only the information you need and display it differently.

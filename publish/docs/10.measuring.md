# Measuring your code

```scala
import stopwatch.Stopwatch

// A stopwatch surrounds your code
Stopwatch("someName") {
  // code being timed
  doSomething()
  somethingElse()
}
```

### Non-inlined code

Sometimes you want to measure the performance of an operation which is not emcompassed by a single code section.  You can then use the __start__ and __stop__ methods to delimit the scope of the operation.

```scala
// get a stopwatch instance
val stopwatch = Stopwatch.start("test")

// and later, elsewhere in your code
// use the same instance to signal completion
stopwatch.stop()

// if there was an error, use error() instead
stopwatch.error()
```

These __start__, __stop__ and __error__ methods can also be used directly by JVM languages other than Scala (e.g. Java, Closure, Groovy) to provide more idiomatic wrappers for inlined code measurement.

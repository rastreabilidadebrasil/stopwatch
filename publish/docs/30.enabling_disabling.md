# Enabling and disabling

There are 3 ways to manage if and how stopwatches are enabled.

## At the group level

As we have seen above, you can enable/disable stopwatches at the group level,

``` scala
// the default group
Stopwatch.enabled = true

// or if you created your own group
myStopwatchGroup.enabled = false
```

By default, groups are disabled.  You must explicitly enable them to monitor your application.   Also, the group's __enabled__ property overrides stopwatches' __enabled__ property (see below).

## "On demand"

If a group is enabled and a new stopwatch name is used, the __enableOnDemand__ property controls whether the new stopwatch is automatically enabled,

``` scala
// the default group
Stopwatch.enableOnDemand = true

// or if you created your own group
myStopwatchGroup.enableOnDemand = false

// when enableOnDemand is false,
// you must explicitly enable stopwatches
myStopwatchGroup.enable("someCode")
```

Otherwise, non-preinitialized stopwatches are disabled by default.  If __enableOnDemand__ is __false__, you must explicitly enable stopwatches (see below).

## Individual stopwatches

In addition to enabling/disabling at the group level, you can also enable and disable individual stopwatches explicitly,

``` scala
// the default group
Stopwatch.enable("myCode")
// or...
Stopwatch.disable("myCode")

// if you created your own group
myStopwatchGroup.enable("myCode")
// or ...
myStopwatchGroup.disable("myCode")
```

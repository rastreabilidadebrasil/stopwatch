# Web Interface

The optional __stopwatch-web.jar__ library provides a small embedded web server to monitor your application in a development/certification setting.  It does not yet provide any security beyond only opening "localhost" loopback-only port.

You can embed the server by inserting the following code fragment in your application's startup code:

``` scala
import stopwatch.web.Server

val server = new stopwatch.web.Server

// register StopwatchGroups you want to monitor
server.groups ::= Stopwatch
server.groups ::= myStopwatchGruop

// configure port number
server.port = 9999

server.start()
```

## Try it!

You can try a sample of the web server by running,

``` sh
% scala -cp stopwatch-1.x.jar:stopwatch-web-1.x.jar stopwatch.web.SampleServer
```

If you point your browser to "http://localhost:9999":http://localhost:9999, you should see:

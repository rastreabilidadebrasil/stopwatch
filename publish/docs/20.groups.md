# Groups

__StopwatchGroup__'s are useful to organize stopwatches, avoid name clashes, and specify behavior for multiple stopwatches at once.

The singleton __Stopwatch__ object that has been used so far in the examples is actually the default __StopwatchGroup__.  You can define other stopwatch groups, each having their own distribution range and enabled/disabled state.

By default, groups are disabled and have no defined range.

```scala
import stopwatch.Stopwatch
import stopwatch.StopwatchGroup
import stopwatch.TimeUnit._

val incomingRequests = new StopwatchGroup("Incoming Requests")

// configure
incomingRequests.enabled = true
incomingRequests.range = StopwatchRange(0 seconds, 30 seconds, 1000 millis)

// usage for code blocks
incomingRequests(clientId) {
  doStuffForClient()
}
```

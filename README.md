Stopwatch
=========

This small Scala library can be used to determine application performance bottlenecks, user/application interactions, and application scalability. Each stopwatch gathers summary statistics such as hits, execution times (total, average, minimum, maximum, standard deviation), distribution, simultaneous requests or concurrent threads.

This library was created from original works by by Alex Boisvert and originally posted @ <https://github.com/aboisvert/stopwatch>.
